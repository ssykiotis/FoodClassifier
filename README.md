# FoodClassifier
This repository contains an attempt to create an image classifier for food classification. This is accomplished by using the fast.ai library that provides a high-level API for implementing neural network models. 

The project is divided in the following sections:

1. Creating an imageset
2. View the data
3. Train the model
4. Results interpretation and error analysis
5. Cleaning up the dataset

The classifier achieves ~89% accuracy.
